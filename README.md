# Appliances-Energy-Prediction
Developed a predictive model using Linear Regression to estimate household energy consumption based on environmental factors like  temperature, humidity, and light levels.
OVERALL PROJECT SUMMARY:
This project focuses on developing a predictive model using Linear Regression to estimate household energy consumption based on environmental
factors such as temperature, humidity, and light levels. The dataset contains 19,735 instances with 28 features, including data from ZigBee sensors
(monitoring indoor conditions) and external weather data from Chievres Airport in Belgium. After selecting the most relevant features through
correlation analysis, the model was trained to predict energy use in watt-hours (Wh). Linear Regression was chosen for its simplicity and interpretability,
providing clear insights into how each factor influences energy consumption. The model was evaluated using a True vs Predicted Energy Consumption
scatter plot and a Residual Distribution histogram to assess its accuracy. While the model is effective, future improvements could include exploring more
complex models like Random Forests and Neural Networks for better accuracy, incorporating additional features like occupancy data and longer time
periods, and integrating external weather conditions for more precise forecasting. The model can be applied to smart home systems to optimize energy
use, potentially saving on electricity bills and promoting sustainability by reducing energy waste
